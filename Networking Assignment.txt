The given command is 
printf ‘HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n’  | nc en.wikipedia.org 80


This command gets http header of en.wikipedia.org website by sending an http request.
It consists of two commands: printf and nc(netcat).


Printf just prints formatted strings.In this case,we are piping two commands so that output of printf is taken as input for nc command.
So,the http request ‘HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n’ is sent to nc command.


nc(netcat) command is used to connect to a server.In this case,it connects to en.wikipedia.org via port 80.It takes the input from printf command i.e. the http request and sends it to en.wikipedia.org.
The server sends back the header of en.wikipedia.org and displays it on the terminal.


The output is:
